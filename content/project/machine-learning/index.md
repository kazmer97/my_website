# Intro

This is an overview of one of my machine learning assignments that I have completed at UCL. Which can be found [here on GitHub](https://github.com/kazmer97/Machine-learning-assigment). 

It consists of 2 challanges:

  1. Develop a model that performed successful gender and smile recognition on celebrity faces.
  2. Develop a model than is able to categorise cartoon faces based on shape and eye color.
