Self help, books are like linkedin.  A lot of pretentious humble bragging repeated unoriginal content and here and there an actual useful bit of information that you could have probably gotten from somewhere else as well. So why is it that it is so prevalent in modern culture? 

Now I am not arguing against the - existence of self help and LinkedIn, but I do believe the wast majority of self help literature
does not promote thinking, which is a prerequisite of growth. They like to trick the reader into feeling like they embark on a journey of discovery and deep thinking or life changing revelation, when in fact they hammer home a few simple points. The trick is in the beginning which always includes an interest grabbing question, that the author has figured out. Then comes several pages of boasting about their life achievements and, how this ever so life changing formula they have propelled them further in life. This serves as an attention grab and making the reader feel impressed by the author. Now at this point the much hyped topic of the book should be coming, but a little more boasting has to take place so the book can happen. The answer is usually revealed at around one third of the book and more often than not is quite self evident. And this is the part where the book should end. 

After this point the books switch to treating the reader like an idiot, hammering home the same points through anecdotes and stories which may or may not be true. So essentially you could cut the second two thirds of these books and the first one quarter with the boasting. Now you would be left with essentially two to five pages of useful information. Maybe you could even put the profiles and boosting of the author on a website and allow them to post the main points.... Oh wait thats linkedin, see how I brought that around. Now these analogies might be somewhat blown out of proportion as both self help and Linkedin has useful content as well. To move away from my bitter analogy above lets dive into why I believe most people would be better off reading fiction (of decent literary value) than self-help. To be clear I do not categories science books into the self help category. (I repeating that word a lot) 

What is fiction with literary value? It is a piece of work that captures a slice of the world, the human condition within a story. Great artists use words much more like a scaffolding or outer layer for their truth where a reader catches a glimpse of a feeling or idea conveying it in full by avoiding the direct formulation of it with imperfect words. In stark contrast with non-fiction where everything is tackled head on. The latter approach while easier to digest captures the world much more imperfectly due to the writer using language and words as building blocks for the truth they try to capture butchering its essence by forcing its completeness and interconnectedness into the limit of word bricks. This fundamental difference in approach yields a different interactions with the reader and the body of work. 

I believe the best example of good writing is focusing on what you can take out from the text. The "A farewell to Arms: The Hemingway library edition" contains the manuscript of the book and how to author progressed in condensing and sharpening the expressiveness of the book by taking things out. I highly recommend checking this out, as it is a form of communication we should all strive towards instead of wasting words. 

In the name of consciousness let me conclude here. What is the reason for this essays existence? Promote literature as a medium for deep thinking about the world and through that engage in self reflection and improvement. Also slightly mock self-help/linkedin culture. There is value in conciseness that is worth exploring and its not the length of a message that determines its value and neither is its author.
