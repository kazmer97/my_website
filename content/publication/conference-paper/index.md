abstract: This paper follows the implementation of a proof-of-concept localization system for GNSS-denied environments. WALLSY (Wireless Ad-hoc Low-power Localization SYstem) is a portable and modular Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) and Smart Mesh IP (SMIP) hybrid. WALLSY uses UWB two way ranging (TWR) to measure distances, which are then sent via the low-power SMIP backbone network to a central hub for calculating coordinates of tracked objects. The system is highly flexible and requires no external infrastructure or prior knowledge of the installation site. It uses a completely nomadic topology and delivers high localization accuracy with all modules being battery powered. It achieves this by using a custom time-slotting protocol which maximizes deep-sleep mode for UWB. Battery life can be further improved by activating inertial measurement unit (IMU) filtering. Visualization of tracked objects and system reconfiguration can be executed on-the-fly and are both accessible to end users through a simple graphical user interface (GUI). Results demonstrate that WALLSY can achieve more than ten times longer battery lifetime compared to competing solutions (localizing every 30 seconds). It provides 3D coordinates with an average spatial error of 60.5cm and an average standard deviation of 15cm. The system also provides support for up to 20 tags.
